# Xamarin Bindings for Garmin Connect IQ Mobile Android SDK

This is a set of Xamarin bindings for the Garmin Connect IQ Mobile SDK, available here: https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/. To build this project, you need to manually download the SDK jar and put it in GarminConnectSDK/Jars, as the license agreement doesn't allow for rehosting of the JAR file. The latest version I've tested with is 1.4 of the Android BLE/ADB SDK.
